Description:
============
 Example that takes samples with the ADC at high-speed.


This example shows the CTIMER-A3 triggering repeated samples of an external
input at 1.2Msps in LPMODE0.  The example uses the CTIMER-A3 to trigger
ADC sampling.  Each data point is 128 sample average and is read from the
ADC FIFO into an SRAM circular buffer.
